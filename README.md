# My VIM stuff (.vim/.vimrc)

My ``.vimrc`` configuration file and VIM plugins, based on 
[mbrochh/vim-as-a-python-ide](https://github.com/mbrochh/vim-as-a-python-ide) presentation from Martin Brochhaus. 

After clone, just execute ``sh install.sh`` or ``install.cmd``, if you are on
Windows.

Enjoy!
